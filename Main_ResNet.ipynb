It mainly depends on the similarity of the test set features to the features of the first 85 days. From the submission of the public list removing the features of the first 85 days can improve the score, indicating that the validation set of the public list is not similar to the features of the first 85 day features are not similar. However, removing the first 85 days of data for training is a controversial point. Some players believe that features that similar to the first 85 days may appear in the future.

Because the distribution of the data in the neural network changes after each layer is activated, which is called Internal Covariate Shift,. The input distribution of the middle layer always changes, which will increase the difficulty of fitting the model. Also, the input distribution of the middle layer will make the output gradually close to the place where the gradient of the activation function is smaller, leading to the disappearance of the gradient, so it is necessary to do data normalization for the output of each layer. It is important to note that the BN layer is placed between the hidden layer and the activation layer.\n",

        ">We build a simple 3-layer neural network model using Keras, an advanced neural network API written in Python and running with TensorFlow as the backend by default. The core data structure of Keras is the model, a way of organizing the network layers. The simplest model is the Sequential sequential model, which consists of multiple network layers stacked linearly. For more complex structures, use the Keras functional API, which allows the construction of arbitrary neural network graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Build models using the Keras functional API:\n",
        "1. Create an input layer with *tf.keras.layers.Input*. The parameters are the dimensions of the training set features.\n",
        "2. Add a BN operation layer and a dropout layer to the output of the input layer, calling the BatchNormaliztion and Dropout APIs provided by *tf.keras.layers*.\n",
        "3. *hidden_units* is a list of the number of incoming hidden layer neurons. The superparameter section has defined that there are 160 neurons in each of the 3 layers.\n",
        "4. Each layer has structured like a sandwich: fully connected layer + BatchNorm layer + activation layer + dropout layer.\n",
        "5. The activation function used is the switch activation function proposed by Google in October 2017: $f(x) = x - \\text{sigmoid}(βx)$. The switch has the properties of no upper bound with lower bound, smooth, non-monotonic. Also, we can use other activation functions such as ReLU.\n",
        "6. **output layer** -> a fully connected layer with an output of 5 (dimensions of the labels) and labels in each dimension is a binary classfication problem (action is 1 or 0). Then we use the sigmoid activation function to do activation on the output of the full connected layer.\n",
        "7. Pass the defined input *inp* and output *out* objects to the model *tf.keras.models.Model* to complete the creation of the model. We can use *keras.utils.plot_model(model, \"model_with_shape.png\", show_shapes=True)* to generate pictures of the model structure.\n",
        "8. Use *model.compile* to configure the training process of the model. We need to specify the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation matrix, which can refer to: https://keras.io/zh/models/model/#compile.\n",
        "9. The optimizer *optimizer* uses RectifiedAdam, which claims to provide fully automatic and dynamic self-tuning of the learning rate, eliminating the \"warm-up\" required by using Adam, ensuring the learning rate and convergence speed, while effectively avoiding the model from falling into the trap of \"local optimum\" trap."
