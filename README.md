My best ranking in this tournament is 60th, if I stabilize above and below this ranking in the end I will be well on my way to a SILVER medal.
But unfortunately there was a "Black Swan" incidents halfway through the tournament, or maybe there was a problem with the network structure I built, causing my ranking to drop to as low as 2,000 places and beyond. I will upload part of my working code for backup, maybe I can find out the reason of my failure from here later.

To build this network stucture, moslty we have to import several toolkits or package. All of them are showm in the notebook file.

Overall code was written in Python using Google Colab Pro which has several paid GPUs and privilage CPU for training.

Any extra information for these codes can contact me by email: <xmrhzeng2000@gmail.com>
